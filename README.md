The core task of this project is to build a complete deep learning training framework. This framework takes CuPy as the underlying computing engine and is responsible for the high-speed operation of tensors and the scheduling of GPU resources. On this basis, common neural network modules including convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, activation functions, batch normalization and Dropout were independently implemented. Meanwhile, to achieve the end-to-end training process, a mechanism supporting automatic forward propagation and backpropagation has also been constructed, enabling each layer to automatically take chain differentiation. To enhance the stability and efficiency of training, this training framework also integrates the automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), Early Stopping mechanism and gradient clipping function, which can better adapt to data and networks of different scales.
The dataset used in this project is CIFAR-10, which is a standard image classification dataset provided by the University of Toronto in Canada. CIFAR-10 contains a total of 60,000 32x32 pixel color images in 10 categories, namely aircraft, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships and trucks. In order to focus on the binary classification problem and simplify the task objective, we select two categories, "Cat" and "Dog", to construct a binary classification problem of cat and dog images with practical significance. A variety of enhancement strategies are applied to the training data, including horizontal flipping of images, random rotation, translation, cropping, color perturbation and luminance variation, etc., to expand the data diversity and prevent model overfitting. Meanwhile, the framework supports preloading data into the GPU and implementing asynchronous caching, significantly enhancing the data throughput capacity during training.
With the rapid development of deep learning technology, convolutional neural networks have been widely applied in numerous fields such as image recognition, object detection, and medical image analysis. Traditionally, these models rely on deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow for implementation. However, although these frameworks are powerful, they are highly encapsulated and have a high level of abstraction. For learners, the underlying computational details are not easy to master.
This project aims to implement a lightweight deep learning training framework based on CuPy and NumPy from scratch and apply it to the classic image recognition task - recognizing cats and dogs from the CIFAR-10 dataset. By implementing modules such as network structure, forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimizer by oneself, one can deeply understand the underlying mechanism of deep learning models and enhance the engineering implementation and optimization capabilities. Furthermore, in this project, CuPy is used instead of the traditional NumPy at the computing layer, which can directly invoke NVIDIA GPU resources and significantly accelerate the computing process while maintaining the underlying control. By implementing a deep learning framework from scratch, students can not only deepen their understanding of the structure and training mechanism of neural networks, but also enhance their comprehensive abilities in code implementation, module design, and system debugging.
Starting from the task itself, although cat and dog image recognition is a simplified problem, it has a high degree of application scalability. This framework can be widely transferred to other image binary classification tasks in the future and can also be used as a benchmark model for transfer learning, with good prospects for research and engineering transformation.
